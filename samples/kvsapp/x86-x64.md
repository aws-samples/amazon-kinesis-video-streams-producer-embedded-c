mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

If you didn't configure sample configurations in file "samples/kvsapp/include/sample_config.h", you need to configure the following environment variables.

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
export AWS_KVS_HOST=kinesisvideo.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

```bash
cd amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-embedded-c/build/
./bin/kvsappcli
```
